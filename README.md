# 👋 Hey, I'm Julia

💻 *Technologist | Builder | Mentor | Debugging Ninja*

Welcome to my GitHub! I thrive on turning ideas into working systems—from full-stack web apps to real-time dashboards and IoT experiments. Whether it's backend logic, frontend finesse, or teaching others how to build, I bring curiosity, clarity, and a hands-on mindset to every project.
